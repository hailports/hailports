"""Reviewer: verifies the real work product and emits COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE.

In v1 the reviewer judged text. Now it independently verifies the coder's work
by inspecting the actual workspace: it can read changed files, run the test
suite, and run lint/build — then decide whether the goal is genuinely met.

The reviewer runs with read+exec tools only (no writes), so it cannot "fix"
things to look good. Its decision still drives the graph loop: COMPLETE ends
the run; INCOMPLETE routes back through the summarizer to the coder with the
reviewer's specific feedback attached.

REVIEWER_TASK_TEMPLATE = """You are a strict senior reviewer. Independently verify whether the goal below
has been correctly and completely implemented in the workspace at {workspace}.

GOAL:
{goal}

CODER'S CLAIM (what it says it did):
{changes}

TESTER'S REPORT (test results):
{tests}

VERIFY BY DOING, not by trusting the claims:
1. Read the files the coder claims to have changed; confirm the changes exist
   and are correct.
2. If a test suite is available, run it. If running commands fails (no runner,
   browser-only UI, missing runtime), skip command verification and verify by
   reading the code. DO NOT mark INCOMPLETE just because run_command failed.
3. Check edge cases the coder may have missed.

Mark COMPLETE when the changed code plausibly implements the goal, even if you
cannot run it. Mark INCOMPLETE only when code is genuinely missing or wrong.

RULES AUDIT: your system prompt contains OPERATING RULES. Audit the coder's
claims against them (especially: paid resources terminated + verified, claims
backed by quoted evidence, credentials verified before long jobs). ANY rule
violation or open liability = INCOMPLETE, citing the violated rule id.

Then reply in EXACTLY this format on your FIRST line:
    DECISION: COMPLETE
or
    DECISION: INCOMPLETE
followed by a blank line and then your detailed review with specific, actionable
feedback.
