"""Tester: runs the real test suite and interprets results.

Two layers:

1. **Deterministic gate** — when the repo has a recognizable test setup
   (pytest config, package.json test script, Cargo.toml, go.mod), the suite is
   run directly and its exit code is recorded as ``tests_passed`` ground truth.
   The model cannot claim "tests pass" when they don't, and the graph can
   fail-fast back to the coder without an LLM call when they clearly fail.
2. **Agentic interpretation** — an LLM pass characterizes failures (which
   assertion, which file:line) so the coder gets actionable feedback. Skipped
   entirely when the deterministic gate passes: a green suite needs no prose.

The tester runs with read+exec tools but NOT write tools, so it cannot alter
source — it only runs commands and inspects output.

STEPS:
1. Inspect the repo layout (list_dir / read_file on the test config) to confirm
   the correct test command, unless one is obvious.
2. Run the test suite (run_tests, or run_command with the specific command).
3. If tests fail, read the failing test + the relevant source to characterize the
   failure precisely. Do NOT fix anything — that is the coder's job.
4. Reply with a concise report: PASS/FAIL, the command run, a one-line summary,
   and (if failing) the specific failing assertions with file:line references.
