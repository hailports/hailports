"""Rules engine: deterministic enforcement of operating rules.

The problem this solves: prompted rules are probabilistic — every model
eventually forgets or ignores a wall of rules at prompt top. So rules live in
three enforcement tiers, strongest first:

1. **Tool-boundary enforcement** (this module): rules from
   ``.wells/rules.yaml`` are checked against every tool call *before* it
   executes. ``block`` refuses, ``confirm`` routes through the approval gate,
   ``warn`` injects the rule verbatim into the model's next observation, and
   ``liability`` registers a stateful obligation (e.g. "rented GPU must be
   terminated") that the run **cannot silently close** while open.
2. **Moment-of-relevance injection**: when a rule fires, its text lands in the
   tool observation the model reads next — one rule, at the exact moment it
   applies, in the freshest context position.
3. **Prompt + audit**: the workspace ``RULES.md`` is injected into every
   system prompt, and the reviewer audits compliance.

Liabilities are persisted to ``~/.wells/liabilities.json`` so a crash or
restart never loses track of a running paid resource.
